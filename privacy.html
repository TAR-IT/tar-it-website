            parent company in the United States. The Google Tag Manager is used on the basis of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The 
            website operator has a legitimate interest in the quick and uncomplicated integration and administration of 
            various tools on his website. If appropriate consent has been obtained, the processing is carried out 
            exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar the consent includes the storage 
            of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the 
            meaning of the TTDSG. This consent can be revoked at any time. The company is certified in accordance with 
            the “EU-US Data Privacy Framework” (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the US, 
            which is intended to ensure compliance with European data protection standards for data processing in the US. 
            Every company certified under the DPF is obliged to comply with these data protection standards. For more
