This is my first personal portfolio webpage hosted by netlify. No frameworks used, no bootstrap, bare hand HTML/CSS (and some JavaScript) for learning purposes. It includes brief information about me, aswell as a portfolio of some projects of mine, my certificates and experiences.

## User Experience

### User Stories

#### Projekt Stakeholder
1. I would like to showcase my experience and passion about coding on a portfolio webpage. It should be a one-pager (except for hygiene sites).
2. The page should include a little "about" section with a brief summary of myself and my work.
3. The page should include an "interests" section that tells about the stuff I do/I am interest to do.
4. The page should include a "guideline" section that abstractly defines my workflow.
5. The page should include a "career" section with my employments.
6. The page should include a "certificate" section that showcases my achieved certificates.
7. The page should include a "project" section that showcases some projects that I finished or that I am currently working on.
8. For legal & privacy reasons, the website should also include hygiene sites like "Privacy Policy" and "Legal Notice".

#### Users
1. As a user, i should be able to contact the owner of the website - at least via email and/or socials. The contact section should be visible directly after visiting the website.
